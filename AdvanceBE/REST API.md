# REST API Design

# 1. Mindset

# 1.1. Why Design First?

- **Think how it works at high level** ‚Üí Cover almost cases ‚Üí Reduce resources
- Better coordination among other teams
- Good designs make you a good engineer, a potential employee

# 1.2. Mindset

- Scalable
- Consistency
- Inspect every single aspect
- **No one fits all (Trade-offs)**

# 2. REST Conventions

# 2.1. HTTP Methods

##### Properties:

- Safety: do not alter the server state/data
- Idempotency: a same request is sent once or multiple times, the response is the same.

##### Operations:

- Create: **POST**
- Read: **GET**
- Update Totally: **PUT**
- Delete/Disable: **DELETE**
- Update Partially: **PATCH**

# 2.2. RESTful API Conventions

- Use Nouns Instead of Verbs
- Plural Nouns
- Use Nesting to Show Relationships
- Versioning
- Slug-case for URL
- Snake_case for request, response body

##### Example: `https://ronin-engineer.com/api/v1/posts/<post_id>/comments`

# 2.3. Exercise 1

##### Write Method + URL for: 1. Create Order 2. Get the detail of order 145 3. Update age of user 34 only 4. Disable user 34

##### Solutions:

- Create Order: `POST /order-service/api/v1/orders`
- Get the detail of order 145: `GET /order-service/api/v1/orders/145`
- Update age of user 34 only: `PATCH /user-service/api/v1/users/34`
- Disable user 34: `DELETE /user-service/api/v1/users/34`
- Note: Prefix paths make routing easier.

# 2.4. Pagination

##### 2 ways:

- Page, size parameters:
  - Example: `GET /users?page=0&size=10`
  - Use case: management portal
  - Must document: Page start counting with 0 or 1
- Offset, limit parameters:
  - Example: `GET /users?offset=0&limit=10`
  - Use case: a infinite scrollable list, newsfeed, logging events, ‚Ä¶

```sql
SELECT * FROM users OFFSET 100 LIMIT 10 ?
```

# 2.4. Problem 01

##### 2 problems:

- Performance issue for a large dataset in relational DB
  - Take time to count all rows
  - Offset scan through rows to know how many should be skipped
- Resource skipping
  - Firstly, get page 1: [1 ‚Ä¶ 10]
  - Then delete X records in page 1: [3 ‚Ä¶ 10] and expectation: page 2: [11 ‚Ä¶ 20]
  - Get page 2 ‚Üí the X first records in page 2 moved to page 1
  - Page 1: [3 ‚Ä¶ 10, 11, 12]
  - Page 2: [13 ‚Ä¶ 24]

##### Solutions:

- Deferred join: (Performance issue)
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM (SELECT id FROM users ORDER BY id LIMIT 100, 10) a USING id JOIN users b ON a.id = b.id;
  ```
- Cursor: (Resource skipping)
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > last_id ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
  ```
- Note: Each solution has its own pros and cons ‚Üí based on requirements to choose the right solution.
- Cursor is not suitable for random ID.

# 2.5. Sorting

##### Examples:

- `GET /products?sort=price:asc,name:desc`
- `GET /products?sort=+price,-name`
- `GET /products?sort=price asc,name desc`
- Note: **White list of sortable fields**

  - Stripe API Reference

# 2.6. Relations

##### One-To-Many

- Get all comments of an article 123: `GET /articles/123/comments`

##### Many-To-Many

- Get students in a class: `GET /classes/<class_id>/students`
- Add a student into a class: `POST /classes/<class_id>/students/<student_id>`
- Note: Using **PUT** here is ok because of **idempotence**
- Add students into a class: `POST /classes/<class_id>/students`
- Body for add students into a class

```json
{
  "student_ids": ["s1", "s2"]
}
```

# 3. Case Studies

# 3.1. Problem 02: Exporting a large file

##### Design API for exporting a file with the size of 500MB.

##### Process:

Query DB --- Write file --- Response file to client directly (not though third party)

##### Issues:

![rest](AdvanceBE/images/rest_api_1.png)

- Request timeout
- Client is blocked
- Out of Mem
- Heavy computation, Large result of the query

## Solution: Polling (Async API)

##### Use case: export file

![rest](/images/rest_api_2.png)

1. API request to export
   - Endpoint: `GET /products/jobs/export?name=pen`
2. API check status
   - Endpoint: `GET /jobs/001`
3. API get job result
   - Endpoint: `GET /jobs/001/result`

###### Flow:

**Client:** Sends export request ‚Üí `GET /products/jobs/export?name=pen`  
**Server:** Creates a job ‚Üí spawns an asynchronous thread to process, returns `job_id = 001`.

**Client:** Sends `GET /jobs/001` multiple times to poll job status.  
**Server:** Returns `processing` ‚Üí then `done` when completed.

**Client:** When status is `done`, calls `GET /jobs/001/result`.  
**Server:** Returns a download link for the file.

### Polling Callback

Use Webhook, BE call BE

![rest](/images/rest_api_3.png)

## Types of Async API

- Polling:
  - Pros: Easy to implement
  - Cons: Waste resource
  - Use case: small load, import/export file
- Callback / Webhook:
  - Pros: Optimize the resource
  - Cons: Complex to implement in both client side and server side
  - Use case: large load, payment

# 3.3. Problem 03

##### Problem: A request might be sent twice due to network issue or replay attack. This problem is sensitive to use cases such as payment, order.

##### Solution:

- Client generates and adds an **Idempotency Key** to the request header.
- Server checks Idempotency Key with unique constraint in DB.

# 4. REST API Document

# What info is important to REST API document?

# 4.1. API Document

##### Resources:

- REST API Document
- REST API Map

##### Note:

- Describe request, response body clearly
- Show all errors and their meanings
- Nice to have cURL samples

# Recap

- Scalable
- Consistency
- Inspect every single aspect
- No one fits all (Trade-offs)
